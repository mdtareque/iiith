## Lec1 : Intro (23 slides) 

Aspect of design : a particular part or feature of something  
  Great Design = Visceral D + Behavioral D + Reflective D

- Visceral D: (related to internal deep feeling/nervous system)
    - making things look pretty
    - is what is present in nature
    - same rules all over
    - reactions to visceral level of design are immediate and powerful.
    - e.g. Banana peel shaped juice bottle. Compact Computer.
- Behavioral D:
    - all about use
    - functionality comes first
    - applying user-centered design
    - bad behavioral D leads to frustation. Many designs fail because they are self-centered
 - Design Target:
    - Function is a Enhancement(easy to create) or Innovation (difficult as it can be measured post release only, and need to images which something user has no experience with)
    - e.g. Remote Control with full of buttons, push door has a pull handle.
    - Understandibility:
    - Design mantra 'Learn once, remember forever'
    - feedback is important component
 - Conceptual Model: mental images of any object
    - Deisgner's model: image in head of designer
    - User's model: image the user using it has it
    - System image: image conveyed by the product and written material
    - Ideal world = designer's model and user's model should be identical
  - Usability:
    - product that does what it required and is understandable but still may not be usable(guitars, pianos)
  - Physical Feel:
    - good products have great physical feel
    - materials make a huge difference in appreciation
    - best of products make full use of interaction between brain and environment
    - tangibility: physical objects have weight, texture and surface
- Reflective D:
   - all about message, culture, meaning of product, it's use
   - linked with person's overall impression of a product. Evoking personal remembrance
    - self-image
    - you avoid things because 'it wouldn't be right'
    - you buy things to support a cause you prefer
   - about long term customer experience, about service, providing and warm interaction
   - e.g watches
